# Vaadin, Mongo & Scala example

This is an example project that contains a simple registration application that uses Vaadin as the UI framework and MongoDB as the permanent storage. The project is implemented as an SBT project using Scala and Scaladin to make Vaadin usage easier.

For MongoDB the Casbah and Salat libraries are used.

This example was inspired by the Scala, Play 2 and Mongo example @ [yobriefca.se](http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/05/08/starter-for-10-scala/).
